## Fields

Each content field is packaged as it's own feature that needs to be enabled.

### Dictionary

Provides content field for managing an arbitrary amount of names and associated values. Items will be displayed on the page as an unordered list with name/value. Below is a screen recording of the field in action.

### Responsive Media

Replica of the media field, however the field can have responsive breakpoints configured, which will be used to display a responsive image via the `picture` element. Content editors can define specific images for particular breakpoints, otherwise a [dynamically resized image](https://orchardcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Media/README/#resize_url) will be used for the breakpoint.

_This field is still in development._

### Values

Content editors can define an arbitary list of values with a user friendly editor experience. Values will be displayed on the page as an unordered list. Below is a screen recording of the field in action.

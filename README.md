### Responsive Media

Replica of the media field, however the field can have responsive breakpoints configured, which will be used to display a responsive image via the `picture` element. Content editors can define specific images for particular breakpoints, otherwise a [dynamically resized image](https://orchardcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Media/README/#resize_url) will be used for the breakpoint.

### Values

Content editors can define an arbitary list of values with a user friendly editor experience. Values will be displayed on the page as an unordered list.
